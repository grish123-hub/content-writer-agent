This project is an AI Content Writer Agent built using the Google Agent Development Kit (ADK).  
It uses the built-in google_search tool to fetch real-time information from the web and  
Gemini 2.5 Flash to generate high-quality LinkedIn posts and blog articles.  
The agent combines live search results with AI writing to produce accurate, updated content  
on topics like job markets, technology trends, and industry insights.  
This project demonstrates AI agent creation, tool integration, and workflow automation using ADK.
